### Introduction:

  The Digital Hourglass is a smart timer device that utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an 8x8 matrix display, an MPU6050 accelerometer, a rotary encoder, a piezo buzzer and a tactile button. The device simulates the traditional hourglass by using the LEDs on the matrix display to depict the sand particles. The device is designed to be versatile and can be used for timing various activities such as cooking, studying or even as a game timer.

### Design:

  The Digital Hourglass is built using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an 8x8 matrix display, an MPU6050 accelerometer, a rotary encoder, a piezo buzzer, and a tactile button. The MPU6050 accelerometer is used to detect the tilt of the device and move the sand particles/LEDs on the matrix display accordingly. The rotary encoder and the tactile button are used to set the timer duration and switch between different modes. The piezo buzzer acts as an alarm once the timer reaches the end.

### Implementation:

  The Digital Hourglass is programmed using the Arduino IDE and the code is written in C++. The code is designed to handle the timing, display updates, and button inputs. The code also includes a function that allows the user to set the timer duration, which can be adjusted as needed. The device is user-friendly and easy to operate.

### Conclusion:

  The Digital Hourglass is a unique and innovative device that combines the traditional hourglass with modern technology. The device offers a fun and interactive way to time various activities and can be used for various purposes. The device is easy to operate and the code is open-source, making it customizable to suit different needs. Overall, the Digital Hourglass is a great tool for anyone looking for a reliable and convenient timer that combines the traditional and the modern.
